# C9-libs
 
This repo contains libraries for the C9 language. Development of these helper libraries is done here, not in the language spec repo.
All libraries are implemented as header only, but some of them are interdependant, so they are not strict single header libraries.

## Libraries

- `arena.h`: Simple arena allocator
- `array.h`: Dynamic array type and functions
- `random.h`: Fast pseudo random number generator
- `status.h`: Status code struct type
- `string.h`: String type and functions
- `types.h`: Basic types
- `types_print.h`: Print functions for basic types
